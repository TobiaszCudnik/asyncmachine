# TODO

## 3.x
- better npm package
  - export types.ts in main cjs bundle
  - publish only the /build dir
  - include the tools, put in /bin
  - examples should use es6 modules
- wiki docs and tutorials
  - update the old examples
  - demos on stackblitz
  - missing JSDocs
  - translate remaining jsdocs examples from coffeescript to ES6
  - make a comparison of `pipe`, `pipe negotiation` to `add`, `add & require`
- `State_end` is missing ` | Promise<boolean | void>` in am-types
- console.warn for a cancelled transition in case of a busy machine
  - include machine ID, source states and target states
- rxjs integration examples - parsing state sets coming from a group of machines
  - parse the stream of states and "mine" complex states eg user behavior
  - demos on stackblitz
- examples of how to use AM as a state manager for React
  - demos on stackblitz
- fix `createChild()`
  - tests
- implement `pipeRemoveBinding(binding)`

## 4.x

- TypeScript 2.9 compat (typed event emitter using Variadic Types)
  - align /bin/am-types
- include prettier in the workflow
- state groups - `FooA`, `FooB`, `FooC`, when all in group `Foo` #engine #api
  - then only one can be active at a time
  - defined by `group` or `switch` or `switch_group`
- `#now()` -> `{ state: clock, state2: clock }` #api
  - `#wasAfter(#now(), #now())` but with a better name
  - `#is({A: 1, b: 34}): boolean`
- move configs to ./configs
- resolve relations using BFS/DFS to achieve full propagation
- sideEffects: false in package.json
- #toggle(name) #api
- #has(name) #api
- merge #when and #whenNot
  - #when(['Foo', 'Bar'], ['Baz']) fires when +Foo+Bar-Baz
- #whenQueueDone - an async method returning when the whole queue got processed
  - used when `if (this.duringTransition()) await this.whenQueueDone();`
- return an ES6 Set when applicable
- #tick() triggers auto states but doesnt explicitly change anything
- tests
  - align broken tests
  - handle all of those `// TODO write a test` places
- manually specified queue for piping (piping from A to B using the queue from C)
- ensure all the state lists and params are shallow copied #api #refactoring

## Later

- stop auto states when Exception is active
- make it possible to serialize a machine to JSON
  - no instance refs, indirect addressing, binary format
- `machine` factory when used without am-types highlights with an error
- FSM interface?
- TimeArray decorator for states, counting times with moment.js API
  - eg number of state sets in last 10 minutes
  - useful for counting request quota limits for API clients
  - separate npm module
  - support timezones
- investigate `[drop:implied]`
- maybe: State_rejected() method, triggered when a certain state wasnt accepted
  - only for target, non-auto states
- implement push signal for abort functions `abort.onAbort(listener)`
- define machines as JSONs
  - state inheritance example (via object spread)
- history API, optional #features
  - logged as an used queue
  - add destination states
  - time?
- improve logs #debug
  - more consistent
  - more levels and better assignments
- make stack traces as short as possible #debug
    - skip 2 stack frames from deferred
- make Any state a real thing #engine
  - arguments?
- synchronous throw when not in a promise #engine
- edge case: piping negotiation, when a further state is cancelling
  - makes the piping inconsistent
  - for now, rely on the self transition
  - in the future, wait with the 3rd transition phase in the machine B
    till the negotiation is finished
- GC and memory management #engine #api
  - track the context of all the bindings
  - auto unbinding unreachable transitions
  - auto unbinding unreachable promises' error handlers
  - memory leaks load tests
- extend the multi states which create new machines (eg for requests) #?
  - separate / mixin / util function / decorator
- remote state machines #?
  - separate / mixin / util function / decorator
- case insensitive state names (when strings) #api
- state as an object (shorter API calls, like `states.A.add()`) #maybe #api
  - considers signals composed out of event emitters (per each signal)
- chai assertion helper #project #api
